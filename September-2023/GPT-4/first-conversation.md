ME: I have an immutable function f(x) in Python. Consider x2 = f(x1), x3 = f(x2), x4 = f(x3). I'd like to accumulate the sequence x2, x3, x4, and so on in an immutable fashion.

Then we have some back-and-forth with me asking the following question:

```
I can have something like this:

from functools import reduce

def square(x):
   return x*x

def f(x, y):
    return {**x, **{y: square(y)}}

reduce(f, range(5), {})

with a nice result:

{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}	

But now I'd like to have... instead of my square(y), I'd like to have a function
g which applies not to y, but to the previous result of its own application.
```

The answer was very close to what I was thinking (a tuple containing a dictionary),
but somehow I was having difficulty getting it right:

GPT-4: Certainly, if you want a function `g` that applies to the previous result of its own application, you'll have to keep track of the "previous result" somehow. One way is to make the "accumulated value" in the reduce function a little more complex than just a dictionary. You could make it a tuple containing both the dictionary and the previous result of applying `g`.

Here's an example:

```python
from functools import reduce

def square(x):
    return x * x

def g(prev_g):
    return prev_g + 1  # This is just an example. Replace with your actual function of `prev_g`

def f(accum, y):
    prev_dict, prev_g_value = accum
    new_g_value = g(prev_g_value)
    new_dict = {**prev_dict, **{y: new_g_value}}
    return (new_dict, new_g_value)

result, _ = reduce(f, range(5), ({}, 0))
print(result)
```

In this example, `g(prev_g)` just adds 1 to its input, as a placeholder for your actual function.

`f` now takes a tuple `accum` as its "accumulated value," unpacks it into `prev_dic`t (the accumulated dictionary) and `prev_g_value` (the previous value of applying `g`), updates both, and returns a new tuple `(new_dict, new_g_value)`.

The reduce function starts with an initial "accumulated value" of `({}, 0)`, and the final result is also a tuple. We extract the dictionary part of it with `result, _ = ....`

---

And indeed the following works:

```python
>>> def g(prev_g):
...     return prev_g + 3
...
>>> def f(accum, y):
...     prev_dict, prev_g_value = accum
...     new_g_value = g(prev_g_value)
...     new_dict = {**prev_dict, **{y: new_g_value}}
...     return (new_dict, new_g_value)
...
>>> reduce(f, range(5), ({}, 0))
({0: 3, 1: 6, 2: 9, 3: 12, 4: 15}, 15)
```
