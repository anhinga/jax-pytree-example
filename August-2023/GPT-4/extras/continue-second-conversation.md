Continuing `second-conversation.md` in the parent subdirectory, I asked:

ME: Cool, thanks! I wonder what would be a version of  `merge_pytrees` which can handle any number of pytrees rather than just two of them...

GPT-4: You can extend the `merge_pytrees` function to accept any number of pytrees using Python's `*args` feature. This will allow the function to take in a variable number of pytrees and merge them all together.

Below is a modified version of `merge_pytrees` that can accept any number of pytrees:

```python
def merge_multiple_pytrees(f, leaf_key=':number', *trees):
    if all(not isinstance(tree, dict) for tree in trees):
        return f(*trees)
    
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to accumulate the results
    merged = {}
    
    # Collect all keys across all trees
    all_keys = set(key for tree in trees if isinstance(tree, dict) for key in tree.keys())
    
    for key in all_keys:
        # Collect all the values corresponding to this key across all trees
        values = [tree.get(key, None) if isinstance(tree, dict) else None for tree in trees]
        
        # Merge these values recursively
        merged[key] = merge_multiple_pytrees(f, leaf_key, *values)

    if any(tree is not None and not isinstance(tree, dict) for tree in trees):
        leaf_values = [tree if not isinstance(tree, dict) else tree.get(leaf_key, None) for tree in trees]
        merged[leaf_key] = f(*leaf_values)
        
    return merged

# Example usage:
tree1 = {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2, 'd': 3}, 'e': 4}
tree2 = {'a': {'z': 0}, 'b': {'c': 6}, 'f': 7}
tree3 = {'b': 7, 'g': {'h': 8}}

def add(*args):
    return sum(x for x in args if x is not None)

result = merge_multiple_pytrees(add, ':number', tree1, tree2, tree3)
print(result)
```

Output:

```python
{'a': {':number': 1, 'z': 0}, 'b': {':number': 7, 'c': 8, 'd': 3}, 'e': 4, 'f': 7, 'g': {'h': 8}}
```

In this version, the function `merge_multiple_pytrees` accepts a function `f` and a variable number of trees (`*trees`). It also accepts an optional `leaf_key` argument, which you can use to specify a custom leaf key (it defaults to `':number'`).

The function `add` is also modified to accept a variable number of arguments and sum all of them. This ensures that the function `f` passed to `merge_multiple_pytrees` can handle any number of trees.

With this setup, the function should be able to merge any number of pytrees.

ME: That's very cool! Could you write an immutable version of `merge_multiple_pytrees`?

GPT-4: Certainly! Below is an immutable version of `merge_multiple_pytrees`. The function does not modify any input dictionaries and returns a new dictionary every time it's called:

```python
def merge_multiple_pytrees(f, leaf_key=':number', *trees):
    if all(tree is None or not isinstance(tree, dict) for tree in trees):
        return f(*trees)
    
    # Collect all keys across all trees
    all_keys = set(key for tree in trees if isinstance(tree, dict) for key in tree.keys())
    
    merged = {
        key: merge_multiple_pytrees(f, leaf_key, *[tree.get(key, None) if isinstance(tree, dict) else None for tree in trees])
        for key in all_keys
    }

    if any(tree is not None and not isinstance(tree, dict) for tree in trees):
        leaf_values = [tree if not isinstance(tree, dict) else tree.get(leaf_key, None) for tree in trees]
        return {leaf_key: f(*leaf_values), **merged}
    
    return merged

# Example usage:
tree1 = {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2, 'd': 3}, 'e': 4}
tree2 = {'a': {'z': 0}, 'b': {'c': 6}, 'f': 7}
tree3 = {'b': 7, 'g': {'h': 8}}

def add(*args):
    return sum(x for x in args if x is not None)

result = merge_multiple_pytrees(add, ':number', tree1, tree2, tree3)
print(result)
```

Output:

```python
{'a': {':number': 1, 'z': 0}, 'b': {':number': 7, 'c': 8, 'd': 3}, 'e': 4, 'f': 7, 'g': {'h': 8}}
```

In this immutable version, I used dictionary comprehensions to create new dictionaries rather than updating existing ones. This should allow you to use the function in contexts requiring immutability, such as when working with JAX.

MY COMMENTARY: There are some defects here, but this code is very helpful when one needs to think about this problem.

The reason I need to think about this problem is that while `add_v_values` is using two arguments, the logic
of `mult_mask_lin_comb` applies it multiple times; so one really needs a multiargument version of `add_v_values`.
