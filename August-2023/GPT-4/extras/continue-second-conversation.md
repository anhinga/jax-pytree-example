Continuing `second-conversation.md` in the parent subdirectory, I asked:

ME: Cool, thanks! I wonder what would be a version of  `merge_pytrees` which can handle any number of pytrees rather than just two of them...

GPT-4: You can extend the `merge_pytrees` function to accept any number of pytrees using Python's `*args` feature. This will allow the function to take in a variable number of pytrees and merge them all together.

Below is a modified version of `merge_pytrees` that can accept any number of pytrees:

```python
def merge_multiple_pytrees(f, leaf_key=':number', *trees):
    if all(not isinstance(tree, dict) for tree in trees):
        return f(*trees)
    
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to accumulate the results
    merged = {}
    
    # Collect all keys across all trees
    all_keys = set(key for tree in trees if isinstance(tree, dict) for key in tree.keys())
    
    for key in all_keys:
        # Collect all the values corresponding to this key across all trees
        values = [tree.get(key, None) if isinstance(tree, dict) else None for tree in trees]
        
        # Merge these values recursively
        merged[key] = merge_multiple_pytrees(f, leaf_key, *values)

    if any(tree is not None and not isinstance(tree, dict) for tree in trees):
        leaf_values = [tree if not isinstance(tree, dict) else tree.get(leaf_key, None) for tree in trees]
        merged[leaf_key] = f(*leaf_values)
        
    return merged

# Example usage:
tree1 = {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2, 'd': 3}, 'e': 4}
tree2 = {'a': {'z': 0}, 'b': {'c': 6}, 'f': 7}
tree3 = {'b': 7, 'g': {'h': 8}}

def add(*args):
    return sum(x for x in args if x is not None)

result = merge_multiple_pytrees(add, ':number', tree1, tree2, tree3)
print(result)
```

Output:

```python
{'a': {':number': 1, 'z': 0}, 'b': {':number': 7, 'c': 8, 'd': 3}, 'e': 4, 'f': 7, 'g': {'h': 8}}
```

In this version, the function `merge_multiple_pytrees` accepts a function `f` and a variable number of trees (`*trees`). It also accepts an optional `leaf_key` argument, which you can use to specify a custom leaf key (it defaults to `':number'`).

The function `add` is also modified to accept a variable number of arguments and sum all of them. This ensures that the function `f` passed to `merge_multiple_pytrees` can handle any number of trees.

With this setup, the function should be able to merge any number of pytrees.
