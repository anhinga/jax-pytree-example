ME: Let's talk about Python JAX. I'd like to build a pytree which is a union of two different pytrees. 

GPT-4: [saying something not too useful]

ME: No, let's say I have two nested dictionaries as pytrees. They might have different structures, they don't have to be similar to each other. I want to build a new tree which contains all paths from the first tree and all paths from the second tree. If a path belongs to both trees, I'd like the resulting leaf to be f(leaf_from_tree1, leaf_from_tree2).

GPT-4: f you want to create a new pytree from two existing pytrees such that it incorporates elements from both, you can write a recursive function to merge the dictionaries. This function can handle cases where the paths overlap and apply a function `f` to the leaves that end up in the same path. Here's an example:

```python
def merge_pytrees(tree1, tree2, f):
    if not isinstance(tree1, dict) or not isinstance(tree2, dict):
        return f(tree1, tree2)

    merged = {}
    # For keys only in tree1
    for key in set(tree1.keys()) - set(tree2.keys()):
        merged[key] = tree1[key]
        
    # For keys only in tree2
    for key in set(tree2.keys()) - set(tree1.keys()):
        merged[key] = tree2[key]

    # For keys in both tree1 and tree2
    for key in set(tree1.keys()) & set(tree2.keys()):
        merged[key] = merge_pytrees(tree1[key], tree2[key], f)

    return merged

# Example usage:
tree1 = {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2, 'd': 3}, 'e': 4}
tree2 = {'a': 5, 'b': {'c': 6}, 'f': 7}

def add(x, y):
    return x + y if x is not None and y is not None else x or y

result = merge_pytrees(tree1, tree2, add)
print(result)
```

This will output:

```python
{'a': 6, 'b': {'c': 8, 'd': 3}, 'e': 4, 'f': 7}
```

The function `merge_pytrees` merges two pytrees, applying the function `f` to the leaves that end up in the same path. For this example, `f` is the `add` function that adds two numbers if they are both not `None`, and returns the one that's not `None` otherwise.

You can replace `add` with any function you'd like to apply to the overlapping leaves.

MY COMMENTARY: Yes, this looks right.

But on further reflection, this has some defects. Let's continue the conversation.

ME: Yes, that's great. I'd like the following two changes. This code does not work correctly when in one the trees a key maps to a number and in another tree the same key maps to a dictionary. Another change I'd like to see, I'd like to do this in immutable style (so that, for example, I would be able to ask JAX to take gradients through this code). 

GPT-4: To handle the case where a key maps to different types in each tree (a leaf node in one tree and a subtree in another), you can modify the `merge_pytrees` function to check the types before attempting to merge them. You can also make the code more immutable by avoiding the modification of existing dictionaries.

Here's the updated code:

```python
def merge_pytrees(tree1, tree2, f):
    if not isinstance(tree1, dict) and not isinstance(tree2, dict):
        return f(tree1, tree2)
    
    if isinstance(tree1, dict) and isinstance(tree2, dict):
        # Merge dictionaries immutably
        common_keys = set(tree1.keys()) & set(tree2.keys())
        only_tree1_keys = set(tree1.keys()) - common_keys
        only_tree2_keys = set(tree2.keys()) - common_keys

        common_key_values = {key: merge_pytrees(tree1[key], tree2[key], f) for key in common_keys}
        only_tree1_key_values = {key: tree1[key] for key in only_tree1_keys}
        only_tree2_key_values = {key: tree2[key] for key in only_tree2_keys}

        return {**common_key_values, **only_tree1_key_values, **only_tree2_key_values}

    # If tree1 is a dictionary but tree2 is a leaf node
    if isinstance(tree1, dict):
        return {key: merge_pytrees(value, None, f) for key, value in tree1.items()}

    # If tree2 is a dictionary but tree1 is a leaf node
    if isinstance(tree2, dict):
        return {key: merge_pytrees(None, value, f) for key, value in tree2.items()}

# Example usage:
tree1 = {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2, 'd': 3}, 'e': 4}
tree2 = {'a': {'z': 0}, 'b': {'c': 6}, 'f': 7}

def add(x, y):
    return x + y if x is not None and y is not None else x or y

result = merge_pytrees(tree1, tree2, add)
print(result)
```

This code uses dictionary unpacking to immutably merge the dictionaries and handles cases where a key in one tree maps to a leaf node and the same key in another tree maps to a subtree.

Note: If you're going to use JAX to compute gradients, be cautious when working with Python dictionaries, as JAX is not designed to work with non-array data types. The gradients would be specific to the array leaves, and the structure of the pytree should not affect the differentiation process.

COMMENTARY: That's better, but we are still losing the numerical leaf. We probably want to apply my favorite trick with replacing `N` with `{':number' N}` in this case.

ME: Thanks! I love how you use ** in return {**common_key_values, **only_tree1_key_values, **only_tree2_key_values}. The only problem is that if there are duplicate keys, the second key would override the first. For example, if tree2 is {'a': 5, 'b': {'c': 6}, 'f': 7} and tree3 is {'b': 7}, then {**tree2, **tree3} would result in {'a': 5, 'b': 7, 'f': 7}. I think I'd like 'b':7 to be pushed to the next level in this case, resulting in something like {'a': 5, 'b': {'c': 6, ':number': 7}, 'f': 7}.

GPT-4: Ah, yes, you're right! If two keys conflict, where one maps to a dictionary and the other maps to a leaf node, we could decide on a special key (like `':number'` as you suggested) to store the leaf node in the dictionary. This way, the key won't be overwritten. Here's how you could do it:

```python
def merge_pytrees(tree1, tree2, f, leaf_key=':number'):
    if not isinstance(tree1, dict) and not isinstance(tree2, dict):
        return f(tree1, tree2)
    
    if isinstance(tree1, dict) and isinstance(tree2, dict):
        # Merge dictionaries immutably
        common_keys = set(tree1.keys()) & set(tree2.keys())
        only_tree1_keys = set(tree1.keys()) - common_keys
        only_tree2_keys = set(tree2.keys()) - common_keys

        common_key_values = {key: merge_pytrees(tree1[key], tree2[key], f, leaf_key) for key in common_keys}
        only_tree1_key_values = {key: tree1[key] for key in only_tree1_keys}
        only_tree2_key_values = {key: tree2[key] for key in only_tree2_keys}

        return {**common_key_values, **only_tree1_key_values, **only_tree2_key_values}

    # If tree1 is a dictionary but tree2 is a leaf node
    if isinstance(tree1, dict):
        return {leaf_key: f(tree1.get(leaf_key, None), tree2), **{key: merge_pytrees(value, None, f, leaf_key) for key, value in tree1.items()}}

    # If tree2 is a dictionary but tree1 is a leaf node
    if isinstance(tree2, dict):
        return {leaf_key: f(tree1, tree2.get(leaf_key, None)), **{key: merge_pytrees(None, value, f, leaf_key) for key, value in tree2.items()}}

# Example usage:
tree1 = {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2, 'd': 3}, 'e': 4}
tree2 = {'a': {'z': 0}, 'b': {'c': 6}, 'f': 7}
tree3 = {'b': 7}

def add(x, y):
    return x + y if x is not None and y is not None else x or y

result1 = merge_pytrees(tree1, tree2, add)
result2 = merge_pytrees(tree2, tree3, add)
print(result1)
print(result2)
```

This should result in the following output:

```python
{'a': {':number': 1, 'z': 0}, 'b': {'c': 8, 'd': 3}, 'e': 4, 'f': 7}
{'a': {'z': 0}, 'b': {':number': 7, 'c': 6}, 'f': 7}
```

Here I've added a special key `':number'` to hold the leaf node value when it conflicts with a dictionary. This way, the key `'b'` can map to both a leaf node and a nested dictionary at the same time.
