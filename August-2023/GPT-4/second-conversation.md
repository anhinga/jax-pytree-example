ME: Let's talk about Python JAX. I'd like to build a pytree which is a union of two different pytrees. 

GPT-4: [saying something not too useful]

ME: No, let's say I have two nested dictionaries as pytrees. They might have different structures, they don't have to be similar to each other. I want to build a new tree which contains all paths from the first tree and all paths from the second tree. If a path belongs to both trees, I'd like the resulting leaf to be f(leaf_from_tree1, leaf_from_tree2).

GPT-4: f you want to create a new pytree from two existing pytrees such that it incorporates elements from both, you can write a recursive function to merge the dictionaries. This function can handle cases where the paths overlap and apply a function `f` to the leaves that end up in the same path. Here's an example:

```python
def merge_pytrees(tree1, tree2, f):
    if not isinstance(tree1, dict) or not isinstance(tree2, dict):
        return f(tree1, tree2)

    merged = {}
    # For keys only in tree1
    for key in set(tree1.keys()) - set(tree2.keys()):
        merged[key] = tree1[key]
        
    # For keys only in tree2
    for key in set(tree2.keys()) - set(tree1.keys()):
        merged[key] = tree2[key]

    # For keys in both tree1 and tree2
    for key in set(tree1.keys()) & set(tree2.keys()):
        merged[key] = merge_pytrees(tree1[key], tree2[key], f)

    return merged

# Example usage:
tree1 = {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2, 'd': 3}, 'e': 4}
tree2 = {'a': 5, 'b': {'c': 6}, 'f': 7}

def add(x, y):
    return x + y if x is not None and y is not None else x or y

result = merge_pytrees(tree1, tree2, add)
print(result)
```

This will output:

```python
{'a': 6, 'b': {'c': 8, 'd': 3}, 'e': 4, 'f': 7}
```

The function `merge_pytrees` merges two pytrees, applying the function `f` to the leaves that end up in the same path. For this example, `f` is the `add` function that adds two numbers if they are both not `None`, and returns the one that's not `None` otherwise.

You can replace `add` with any function you'd like to apply to the overlapping leaves.

MY COMMENTARY: Yes, this looks right. This is great, superuseful!
